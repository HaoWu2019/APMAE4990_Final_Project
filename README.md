# APMAE4990_Final_Project

## NYC Taxi ETA

This project aims to build different models to predict travel time between two points in New York City by using the New York yellow cab data in 2016 from Big Query.

The models we built include **Linear Regression Model**, **Decision Tree Model**, **Random Forest Model**.

The features we used:

`visib`: Countinuous variable, the mean visibility for the day in miles.

`wdsp`: Continuous variable, the mean wind speed for the day in knots.

`fog`: Categorical variable, indicators for the occurrence of fog during the day (1=yes, 0=no/not reported).

`rain_drizzle`: Categorical variable, indicators for the occurrence of rain during the day (1=yes, 0=no/not reported).

`snow_ice_pellets`: Categorical variable, indicators for the occurrence of snow during the day (1=yes, 0=no/not reported).

`distance_in_km`:

`week_index`:

`rain_level`: Categorical variables, indicators for the rain levels of the day. There are four levels including no rain, light rain, moderate rain, and heavy rain. There are 3 dummy variables in total for the rain_level feature.

`rush_hour_ind`:

`avg_travel_time`:

`avg_hr_travel_time`:

`avg_trip_dist`:

`avg_hr_trip_dist`:

`avg_fare_amount`:

`avg_hr_fare_amount`:
